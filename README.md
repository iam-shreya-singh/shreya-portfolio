# Shreya Singh - This Portfolio is a Project

Hi, I'm Shreya, and welcome to my corner of the web. 
This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio, which you can view live at **[ ]**.

## The Philosophy

Like many developers, my best projects are always a work-in-progress. So, I asked myself: how can I prove what I can do *right now*? The answer was to treat my portfolio as its own showcase project.

My goal was to build a site that *feels* aliveâ€”something that responds to you, surprises you, and maybe even makes you smile. It's a hands-on demonstration of my skills in creating dynamic and engaging web experiences from end to end.

## Features & Technologies

As you explore the site, you'll find a few key features I built to bring little ideas to life:

*   **Interactive 3D Crystal:** A shimmering, mouse-tracking geometric crystal in the hero section, built from scratch using **Three.js**.
*   **"Catch the Bugs!" Game:** A playable mini-game built with vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and game state management.
*   **Live API Integration:** The "GitHub Stats" widget dynamically fetches and displays my latest repository and follower counts from the official **GitHub API**.
*   **Functional Contact Form:** The "Get In Touch" form is fully functional, using **Web3Forms** to handle submissions and send them directly to my email without a traditional backend.
*   **Advanced Animations:**
    *   The "exploding" tech stack icons on project cards are powered by **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**.
    *   The "typing" rolodex effect in the hero section uses **Typed.js**.
    *   Subtle scroll animations are handled by **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** The entire site is fully responsive and features a professional preloader, a dark/light mode theme toggle, and a custom mouse-following gradient glow.

## Tech Stack

This project was intentionally built without a major framework to showcase strong foundational skills.

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Libraries:** Three.js, GSAP, Typed.js, AOS
*   **Services:** Web3Forms
